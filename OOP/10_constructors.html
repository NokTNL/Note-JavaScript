  // We typically create single objects by the object literals syntax "{}"
  // How about if we want to create a bunch of new objects with the same structure?

  // We can use a "template" function that chucks out new objects with the same structures when called
  // In JavaScript, *one of the ways* of doing this is to call any function with the `new` keyword, ...
  // ... which will modify the behaviour of the function during execution.
  // A function called with `new` is called a CONSTRUCTOR function, example:
  //   - Note: Constructor functions by convention are named in UpperCamelCase
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.introduceSelf = function () {
      console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
    };
  }
  // When called with `new`, e.g.:
  const person = new Person("Mary");
  // What `new` does under the hood is equivalent to:
  function Person(name) {
    // this = {};
    this.name = name;
    this.introduceSelf = function () {
      console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
    };
    // return this;
  }
  // --> now we have a returned object with the structure we want!
  // Note: the new `person` is called an INSTANCE of the Person constructor. Instances typically use lowerCamelCase.

  // !! Don't call arrow functions with `new` because they don't bind 'this'!!!
