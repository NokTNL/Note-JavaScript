  // The `class` syntax makes OOP inside JS easier. Under the hood, it stills uses the constructor function mechanisms and prototype assignment mentioned in prev. notes.
  //
  // A `class` defines the template of objects
  // Use UpperCamelCase for classes
  class Product {
    /**
     * Fields
     */
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields#public_instance_fields
    // class fields will become the object instance's OWN properties
    //
    imageUrl; // this will become `this.imageUrl` in the object instance
    // (Optional) assign an initial value to the property
    title = "Default"; // !!! Use assignment (=) and semicolon (;), NOT `title: "Default",` !!
    // These will be overridden by assignment in `constructor()`; it is optional to state properties assigned in `constructor()` here but is good to state here for clarity

    /**
     * Methods
     */
    // !! This will be declared in the PROTOTYPE of the new instances.
    // This is different from declaring a function in the `constructor()`, see below
    // !! methods defined in a class like this will be NON-ENUMERABLE; they will NOT be iterated in `for ... in`
    someMethod() {
      console.log("this is someMethod in the class Product");
    } // !! no COMMAS between methods

    /**
     * `constructor()`
     */
    // `constructor()` is called when a new object is constructed. Behaves exactly like classical JS constructor functions in terms of `this` binding
    // It is OPTIONAL if you don't need to instantiate an object with a specific set of parameters
    // All the properties (assigned as own props) & methods (passed from F.prototype) above will already have been defined so you can refer to them in the constructor correctly
    constructor(title, imageUrl) {
      this.title = title;
      this.imageUrl = imageUrl;
      // You can declare methods here as well like below, but is NOT advised because you will make identical copies of it.
      this.duplicatedmethod = function () {};
    }
  }

  // Create new objects with 'new'
  // This will call the `constructor()` inside the class
  // !!! Using `class` without `new` will throw error; this solves the common mistake of calling constrcutors without `new` prior to when `class` syntax was introduced
  const product = new Product(
    "A Pillow",
    "https://www.maxpixel.net/static/photo/2x/Soft-Pillow-Green-Decoration-Deco-Snuggle-1241878.jpg"
  );

  // Class expression (similar to function expression): alternative way to declare class
  const AnotherClass = class {
    whatever = "";
  };

  /**
   * Under the hood
   */
  // https://javascript.info/class#what-is-a-class
  // `class` is a special type of function that returns a constructor function on declaration
  // The returned constuctor function has exactly the same name as the class (e.g. `ClassName`), and it copies the code from the class's `constructor()`
  // it also stores all methods defined in the class in the returned constructor (e.g. `ClassName.prototype`)
  //
  // At instantiation:
  // 1. The fields are assign to the new `this`
  // 2. The prototype is assigned to `this`
  // 3. The constructor() code is run
