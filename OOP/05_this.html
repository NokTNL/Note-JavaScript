  /**
   * Why do we need `this`?
   */
  // In OOP, everything are grouped in different OBJECTS.
  // Objects can have PROPERTIES (we learned that already) as well as METHODS (functions belonged to the object)
  //    - In JS, methods are actually also properties but hold FUNCTIONS as values (using function expression syntax)
  // Let say we have the following object:
  const dog = {
    // Properties
    name: "Bob",
    age: 6,
    // Methods
    bark: function () {
      console.log("Woof!");
    },
  };
  dog.bark(); // "Woof!"

  // How about if we want the methods to do something related to the PROPERTIES?
  // We can't just call `name` or `age` as they are not declared as VARIABLES (using `const` or `let`)
  //  - !!! An object in JavaSript CAN'T OWN variables! (unlike in the global script / in functions)
  // Instead, we need something to refer to THIS object and retrieve THIS object's properties
  // --> *** that is what `this` is for: enables methods to retrieve the SAME object's properties
  // e.g. `this` refers to the `dog2` here
  const dog2 = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 6,
    describeMe: function () {
      console.log(`My name is ${this.name}, I am ${this.age} years old!`);
    },
  };
  dog2.describeMe(); // `My name is Bob, I am 6 years old!`

  // We can even reuse the method in ANOTHER object and `this` will refer to the new object!
  // !!! This is called "unbound this", which is different from many other languages
  //    - https://javascript.info/object-methods#this-is-not-bound
  // The value of `this` is determined at RUNTIME, and will point to the OBJECT who CALLED it
  // One way of remembering is that `this` refers to the "before-dot" object
  const cat = {
    name: "Lizzie",
    age: 10,
    // Just copying the whole method from `dog2` by reference
    describeMe: dog2.describeMe,
  };

  // `this` inside `cat.describeMe` will correctly refer to `cat`
  cat.describeMe(); // My name is Lizzie, I am 10 years old!

  /**
   * `this` can point to weird entities
   */
  // Sometimes, `this` in JavaScript may point to something weird
  // First we need to understand what an EXECUTION CONTEXT is
  //  - https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/executable-code-and-execution-contexts.html#sec-execution-contexts
  // The easist way of visualise it is to look at the "Call stack" (aka "execution context stack") in e.g. Chrome DevTools
  // - When we run the global script, it creates the GLOBAL CONTEXT, which is seen as the "(anonymous)" context at the bottom of the call stack
  // - When we have a new function called, it creates a new FUNCTION CONTEXT which is then pushed to the top of the stack
  // - Any function called within that function will create another new function context and pushed on top of the parent context as well
  // - The "Running execution context" means the TOP context in the stack

  // `this` binds to different thing in different context
  //  - the "thing" is loosely equal to "what object called the function"

  /** The GLOBAL context **/
  // `this` refers to the the GLOBAL OBJECT ("the global object called the global function")
  // Consider the below, we call `this` directly in the global "anonymous function":
  console.log(this); // Window

  /** The FUNCTION context **/
  // In a function context, `this` refers to the object who called it (as explained)
  // !!! if we are in a NESTED function call, the JS engine will go all the way down the call stack ...
  // ... until it finds a context that was called by an object (which binds to `this` of that context)
  // - Details: https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/executable-code-and-execution-contexts.html#sec-resolvethisbinding
  //
  // !!! `this` === undefined when we call a function stored in `const` or `let`
  const describeMe = dog2.describeMe;
  // `const` or `let` does NOT belong to the global object, it is a VARIABLE
  // So calling describeMe() will === calling by no one and gives `this` === undefined:
  try {
    describeMe(); // <-- TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  // !!! `this` === undefined in a function declaration in the global context (NOT from an object)
  function callThis() {
    console.log(`callThis: ${this}`);
  }
  callThis(); // undefined!!!
  // For the above we are calling the `callThis` as a "variable", even though ...
  // ... function declaration also doubly assigned it to the global object; the "function variable" takes precedance
  // Therefore, it is NOT called from the global object and is called from NOTHING --> this === undefined!
  //   - This is NOT the case if you use non-strict mode; in that case it will give you the global object @_@...
  // !! But this will give you the global object again:
  this.callThis(); // Window

  /**
   * Binding "this" manually
   */
  // We can force what object "this" refers to in a function even if it was not called from that object
  // bind() will return a NEW function that has `this` bound to the specified object
  getFormattedTitle = getFormattedTitle.bind(movie); // now `this` inside the function refers to the original `movie` object
  console.log(getFormattedTitle()); // "STAR WARS"
  // call() will bind "this" for the function and CALL the function straight away: (apply() is similar)
  console.log(getFormattedTitle.call(movie)); // "STAR WARS"
