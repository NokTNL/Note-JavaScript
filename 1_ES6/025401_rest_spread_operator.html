  /**
   * Rest operator (...) in parameters
   */
  // the function below takes ANY number of arguments passed in and packed into an ARRAY called 'args'.
  // The order of the items in `args` follows the order passed into the function.
  const sum = (...args) =>
    // Then you can do something from the `args` array
    // below is just an expression that returns the sum
    args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6

  /**
   * Spread operator (...) for arrays
   */
  // Objects (incl. arrays and functions) are passed by reference other than values
  // https://codeburst.io/explaining-value-vs-reference-in-javascript-647a975e12a0

  let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
  let arr2;
  arr2 = arr1; // This copies the address of arr1 other than the values inside
  arr1[0] = "blahblah";
  console.log(arr2); // arr2 will also be changed

  // The spread operator `...` 'spreads' the array out into its individual VALUES instead (not the reference of the original arr anymore!)
  let arr3 = [4, 5, 6];
  let arr4;
  // `...arr3` spreads out arr3 into its values, then we pack them into a new array literal []
  arr4 = [...arr3];
  arr3[0] = "blahblahblah";
  console.log(arr4); // arr4 is not changed

  // Spread operator works for any iterables, incl. strings
  console.log([..."BLAH"]); // returns ['B', 'L', 'A', 'H']

  /**
   * Difference between spread and rest operator
   */
  // They share the same form (`...`), but:
  // - rest operator works at declaration side
  const sum1 = (...args) => args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  //            ^ Declaring how to call the paramters, not USING it yet
  // - spread operator works at the expression (using) side
  const arr10 = [...arr3];
  //             ^ Using arr3 and tell JS we want to spread it

  /**
   * Spreading arrays into arguments
   */
  // e.g. using the sum() function defined above:
  const arr5 = [5, 10];
  const mySum = sum(5, ...arr5);
  //                   ^ This is SPREAD operator because you are USING the function and arr5 as expressions
  //                   This spreads arr5 into a list of ARGUMENTS
  console.log(mySum); // 20

  /**
   * Spreading objects (Since ES2018)
   */
  const myMovie = {
    info: {
      title: "Star Wars",
      director: "George Lucas",
    },
    id: 1,
  };
  let myNewMovie = { ...myMovie }; // Spreaded all prop-value pairs as VALUES (not reference) and packed into an object literal
  myNewMovie.id = 2; // This will not affect myMovie, BUT!!!
  myNewMovie.info.title = "Changed"; // This WILL affect the original object
  // Because '...' only does a SHALLOW copy for `info` and `id`. Only the top layer were passed by values.
  // The nested object as a value of the prop was still a pointer and was still passed by referece.
  // A way to manually do deep copy is to use nested '...' and take advantage of that later prop-value pairs override older ones:
  myNewMovie = { ...myMovie, info: { ...myMovie.info } };
  // !!! DON'T try to spread a plain JS object into an array literal, as JS objects are NOT ITERABLE
  // However, spreading an array into an object literal is possible as arrays are actually special objects
  let obj = { key1: "value1" };
  // let array = [...obj]; <-- ERROR

  // !!! Note that for either spread/rest operator, it must be wrapped in a (...),
  // [...] or {...} to work. Think like the list of values must have a container to be
  // meaningful. So the below code doesn't work:
  //  const arr6 = ...arr5; // ERROR (what do you want me to do with the list of values?)
