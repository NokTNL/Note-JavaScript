  // A CLOSURE is a record of a function together with the states of its surrounding scopes (known as the "lexical environment").
  // A JavaScript function always creates closure when it is created
  //
  // One interesting result of closure in JS is that an inner function "remembers" all the variables & parameters accessible to it, ...
  // ... incl. those from the outer scopes, even when the scope holding those values no longer exists
  // Example:
  function outerFunc(outerVar) {
    function innerFunc(innerVar) {
      console.log(`outerVar: ${outerVar}`);
      console.log(`innerVar: ${innerVar}`);
    }
    return innerFunc;
  }

  const newInnerFunc = outerFunc("Outer");
  // Imagine what happens when executing outerFunc:
  /*
    function outerFunc(outerVar) {

      // When this function is declared, it records all the variables accesible to it, including all of those in the outer scopes
      function innerFunc(innerVar) {
        console.log(`outerVar: ${outerVar}`);
        console.log(`innerVar: ${innerVar}`);
      }

      return innerFunc;
      //     ^^^^^ the returned function still "remembers" the variable `outerVar` and it is still accesible to it
      // even though the function holding it (`outerFunc`) has already finished execution and the scope has already gone 
    }
   */
  newInnerFunc("Inner"); // "outerVar: Outer, innerVar: Inner"

  // Functions stored in the heap DO NOT REMEMBER what parameters was put into it when it was last executed (i.e. push into the STACK as an "instance")
  // So when we repeat what we did above, but with a new `outerVar`, the new function returned will have a closure that only remembers the new `outerVar`
  const newInnerFunc2 = outerFunc("OWOWOWWWW");
  newInnerFunc2("Inner"); // "outerVar: OWOWOWWWW, innerVar: Inner"

  // And when the outer scope has NOT gone yet, its variables is (of course) still accesible to the inner scope, ...
  // ... AND the inner scope will always refer to the latest value of it

  let globalVar = "GLOBAL";

  function outerFunc2() {
    function sayGlobalVar() {
      console.log(`globalVar : ${globalVar}`);
    }
    return sayGlobalVar;
  }

  const sayGlobalVar = outerFunc2(); // `globalVar` is remembered by `sayGlobalVar`
  sayGlobalVar(); // "GLOBAL"

  globalVar = "OOPS!"; // <-- `globalVar` is still modifiable by us
  sayGlobalVar(); // "OOPS!"
