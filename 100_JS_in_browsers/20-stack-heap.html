<!-- 
    Heap = long-term storage, Stack = execute scripts when they are pushed into it

  // When we call greet() here, `greet` is executed by being pushed on top of our anonymous global function:
  // STACK: (anonymous) --> greet()
  // The top function on the stack is ALWAYS the active function being executed at the momemt
  greet();
  // Inside greet we also call getName, so the stack becomes:
  // STACK: (anonymous) --> greet() --> getName()
  // getName() also calls prompt() so we have yet another layer:
  // STACK: (anonymous) --> greet() --> getName() --> prompt()
  //
  // When a function RETURNS, it is POPPED from the stack
  //

  // When the whole GLOBAL (anonymous) script has finished execution, (anonymous) will be popped from the stack as well, leaving it empty
